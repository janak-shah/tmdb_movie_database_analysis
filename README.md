This repo queries The Movie Database API (TMDB), which doesn't have a python wrapper. It acts a a practise set for obtaining and analysing APIs that dont have a python wrapper and directly need to be queried. 

We cover the following tasks:
basics finding actor ids, movie ids
actors/actresses filmography 
yearwise most popular movies, tv shows, highest grossing
most popular movies, tv shows of all time
language wise screening of movies and shows , popularity, highest grossing
analytics - for an actor what is the average earnings  that his or her films make, etc 

Once again as with other programs here too enter your api key in a file called api_key.txt to access the api data. For which you might have to create the account of the api
By default all blocks have been commented out, you can execute the file blockwise.
